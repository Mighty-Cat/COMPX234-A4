# COMPX234-A4

This is the implementation of a UDP-based client-server file transfer system for COMPX234 Assignment 4. The project includes a server (`UDPServer.java`) that sends files, a client (`UDPClient.java`) that downloads files, and a test runner (`TestRunner.java`) to automate testing.

## Project Structure
- `UDPServer.java`: The server program that listens for DOWNLOAD requests and sends files using UDP.
- `UDPClient.java`: The client program that requests and downloads files from the server.
- `TestRunner.java`: A script to set up and run tests with the server and client.
- `text1.txt` and `text2.pdf`: Example test files for the server.
- `README.md`: This file with instructions.
